The site is fully responsive and designed to showcase skills, certificates, and projects in a visually engaging way.

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
This project uses CDN links for all its dependencies, so there is no need for a complex build setup (like Node.js or npm). You can run it directly in your browser.

Prerequisites
You just need a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) and a code editor (like VS Code).

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/PrajwaldotS/your-repository-name.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd your-repository-name
Open the index.html file:
Simply open the index.html file in your web browser to see the portfolio live. For the best development experience, I recommend using a live server extension (like the "Live Server" extension in VS Code) to see your changes in real-time.

üé® Customization
It's easy to customize this portfolio and make it your own. All content is located within the index.html file.

Personal Information:

Home Section: Edit the <h1> and <p> tags inside the <section id="home"> to change your name and tagline.

About Section: Update the paragraphs inside <section id="about"> to reflect your bio.

Skills: In the "Skills & Expertise" area, you can change the skill names and adjust the percentage by modifying the inline style="width: XX%" attribute in the .skill-fill divs.

Certificates & Projects:

Both the Certificates and Projects sections are built with reusable card components.

To add, remove, or modify an item, simply copy/paste or edit a <div> with the class .certificate-card or .project-card.

Update the href attribute in the <a> tags to link to your certificates or project demos.

Contact Information & Socials:

Go to <section id="contact">.

Update your email, phone number, and location in the contact info cards.

Change the href attribute in the social media links (<a href="...">) to point to your profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.).

Colors & Styling:

The background gradients for each section are defined in the <style> tag at the top of the file. Look for the .gradient-bg-* classes to change the colors for both light and dark modes.
